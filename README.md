# BetterAlts

BetterAlts is a plugin to allow for multiple profiles on a minecraft server via one mojang account. This solves the common pay to win issue of alts by allowing you to force players to use in-game resources to maintain their advantages. Players can log in to the server by prepending the name of their alt to the server IP.
